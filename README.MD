# SLang
SLang is a simple WIP Java bytecode assembler and disassembler.
I created this project to learn about the structure of the JVM, `class` files and
the code generated when I click build
# Usage
## Assembler
Currently, the assembler is only partially implemented, and does not support all opcodes/instructions
To run the assembler, invoke the `-all` jar generated by `gradlew shadowJar` like this:
```
java -jar SLang-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -m ASSEMBLE -in <source file> -out <classname>.class
```
The assembler will print a representation of the parsed info to stdout, and write the java classfile to the output specified file.<br>
For an example assembly file, check out `hello.s` for a `Hello, World!`
# Disassembler
Currently, the disassembler is not implemented, amd will throw an exception if attempted to be used
